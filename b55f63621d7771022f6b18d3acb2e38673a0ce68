Check pipeline for a plugin can be acivated in zuul/config as it was done in: [1] or in plugin directory itself like it is done here.\n\nGiven that James activated check pipeline for code-owners plugin recently in zuul/config and not in code-owners plugin, I prefer to do it consistently in the same place. (Unless I am missing something, why would we like to activate the check pipeline in different places for different plugins).",
