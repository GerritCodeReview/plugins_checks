      "message": "Now we have a problem. We don\u0027t have stable-3.4 branch yet for this plugin. However, the renaming change 301765 is only included on master. We also cannot create stable-3.4 branch, because we want the canges from the whole series, with checks UI refactoring and fix for issue 14336.\n\nI see two options:\n\n* 1. we cherry-pick the renaming change 301765 to stable-3.4 branch.\n* 2. we create stable-3.4 branch from the tip of master branch in checks plugin and revert this change on stable-3.4 branch.\n\nI would rather do plan 1. but we already published RC3 and actually we should\u0027t do any functional changes any more.",
