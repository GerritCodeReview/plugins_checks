      "message": "i think you should decouple showCheckMessage from the checks. If your check holds the service response, then let it be the same as service response, state like showCheckMessage can be stored in a separate map, every check has a check_uuid, so its pretty easy to map the state with every check",

      "message": "i think you can solve both issues by just changing the interface of your check (or displayedCheckItem), something like: `{check: serviceResCheck, ...otherStates}`, then you don\u0027t need to worry about assigning new checks from API response while persisting your states..",

      "message": "Generally I agree with Tao in that `showCheckMessage` should be kept separate from the `check` object itself. Eventually we would want a ChecksStore/ChecksService to maintain the overall checks state. Then you would go even further and let `checks` be managed by the store, but UI state local to gr-checks-view or gr-checks-item would be kept locally. So `checks` and `showCheckMessage` would then be separated even more.\n\nIf you are going to refactor this, then I would recommend to make `showCheckMessage` a property of \u003cgr-checks-item\u003e and move all 3 \u003ctr\u003e elements from \u003cgr-checks-view\u003e into \u003cgr-checks-item\u003e. Then you don\u0027t have to maintain a map at all.\n\nThat said, I am fine with dealing with that in a separate change. Especially given that Dmitrii is waiting for the bug to be fixed.",
