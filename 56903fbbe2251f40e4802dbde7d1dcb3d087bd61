I\u0027m still seeing some strange behavior (e.g. two requests happening just a few seconds apart before there is a large gap to the next request; or executing those update requests even on the diff screen) but I think we can fix them separately.\n\nI also tested whether this change actually does what it claims to do (\u003d stop polling when tab is out of focus). Maybe I did something wrong but I still see polling happening when the tab is out of focus. Could we test this together again so that I\u0027m not in a weird local state?",
