      "message": "That would require registration of new Group-Id on Sonatype Jira project. I wonder if we should instead use the existing Group id from gerrit itself, and move the word \"checks\" from groupId to artifactId:\n\n  com.google.gerrit:checks-rest-api-client:3.1.0\n\nOr, even dot instead of dash in artifactId name:\n\n  com.google.gerrit:checks.rest.api.client:3.1.0\n\nThat would have three advantages:\n\n* We could just re-use this Sonatype issue: [1].\n* If the checks plugin would be promoted to core plugin: we wouldn\u0027t need to change anything\n* If the checks plugin feature would be moved to core gerrit: we wouldn\u0027t need to change anything\n\n* [1] https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-7392",

      "message": "I think this is a good idea, although this should probably be discussed by the steering committee. Another solution would be to open up `com.google.gerrit.plugins`. That would be more work now, but at least build a foundation for later and would keep it separated from core components.\n\nI would prefer the artifactId with dashes, since this style is already used in com.google.gerrit and in my observation is the more widely used style.",
