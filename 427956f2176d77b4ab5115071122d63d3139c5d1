      "message": "lodash is currently only in bower_components because of WCT. gerrit-review currently does not serve it. I would prefer to not pull in another library, if it can be avoided. How much trouble would it be to do the throttling without lodash?\n\n*If* we add another library, then I would maybe consider rxjs and its throttleTime operator instead of lodash. I am not really a javascript expert and cannot say whether lodash is a great library, but I would prefer to either fully embrace lodash or not use it at all.",
