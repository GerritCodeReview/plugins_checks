      "message": "This defeats the purpose of this feature.  If you have a linter that must run across several repositories (say google-java-format across all of the 100 repos on gerrit-review), it is easy to have more than 10 checkers for a single scheme.\n\nAn analyzer has no way of knowing whether there will be less than 10 checkers in advance, so it will have to implement a fallback for this case, largely undoing the benefit of this feature.\n\nInstead of erroring out, could you make this return a random selection of pending checks instead? The CI system could process the checks, setting their status, and then come back for the next 10 pending checks.",
