      "message": "For all \u0027createdOn\u0027 and \u0027updatedOn\u0027 timestamps on checkers and checks: We need a test that those timestamps contain a reasonable value. CheckerOperationsImplTest only tests the same as here: that the timestamps of the Checker and the CheckerInfo object match. In my opinion, the real test for the timestamps should be here (in GetCheckerIT) and in GetCheckIT. We can also do this in a separate change if you think that would be better.",
