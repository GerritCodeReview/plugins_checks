Or restructure a bit like `gr-change-list-view` and the `gr-change-list` structure.\n\n`gr-change-list-view` -\u003e multiple components (gr-change-list, gr-user-head, gr-repo-header, etc)\n\nand each component has their logic inside.",

      "message": "Tao is right. gr-checkers-list-view started out as a copy of gr-list-view and on the one hand it is nice to have a generic list view factored out. But given the amount of properties and events that are passed back and forth between gr-checkers-list-view and gr-checkers-list I would recommend to fold both components into one. The resulting component won\u0027t become *that* big, and overall it will be more readable for someone looking at the component the for the first time. WDYT?",
