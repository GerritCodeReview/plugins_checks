      "message": "That is weird. Why would the list make an API call, if it is not visible at all? And why would an API response be an indication for the list to become visible? It would nicer, if the checks-view would fully control the \"list is visible\" aspect.",

      "message": "There is an overlay between gr-checks-view and gr-checkers-list which is the one that ultimately needs to be opened. That\u0027s the reason checkers-list is firing an event to tell checks-view to open the overlay.\nI can have checks-view making the getCheckers call and ultimately deciding if overlay needs to be shown or not. I was unsure if I wanted to move the getCheckers functionality from checkers-list to checks-view.",
